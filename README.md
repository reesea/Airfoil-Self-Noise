# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performing non-regularized linear regression to solve a supervised regression problem on the dataset and
predict scaled sound pressure level.

## Dataset
NASA data set consisting of 1,503 instances, each with 6 attributes obtained from a series of aerodynamic and 
acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel.
