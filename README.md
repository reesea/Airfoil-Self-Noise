Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and 
non-regularized linear regression to solve a supervised regression problem on the dataset and
predict scaled sound pressure level.
The data consists of 1,503 instances, each with 6 attributes obtained from a series of aerodynamic and 
acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel.
More details about the dataset can be found at the University of California, Irvine at UCI Machine Learning Repository Data Set page
